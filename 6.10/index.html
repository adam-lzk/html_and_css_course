    <h2>The Problem</h2>

      <p>Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.

        What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.
        
        But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:
        An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.
        
        Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely decentralized.
      </p>


    <h3>We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a network to make the strongest supercomputer the world has ever seen.</h3>
